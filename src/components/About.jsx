      <h2>
        I like to solve problems
      </h2>

      <p>
        Building design is, essentially, a series of creative problem-solving 
        on different scales, e.g.: 
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          How can a building contribute to a street or uplift a neighbourhood
        </li>
        <li>
          How can the building envelope be arranged / shaped to improve the 
          interior light quality and building climate.
        </li>
        <li>
          How to enhance the layout of a space to improve the function of it.
        </li>
        <li>
          Ultimately, how to provide a better User Experience.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        In my current role, which is more focused on the technical and logistical 
        aspects of getting a building constructed, problems often arise on site
        that requires quick thinking. Alternative solutions need to be found in 
        order to reach the same intended goal.
      </p>

      <h2>
        I like to learn
      </h2>

      <p>
        What makes every new project unique, is the need to learn the 
        specific requirements, restrictions, opportunities and context 
        that relates to that project or building. 
      </p>

      <p>
        After doing online courses through FreeCodeCamp, Scrimba, Udemy 
        and YouTube the real learning leap came when I started building 
        my own projects using HTML, CSS, JavaScript with React. I attend 
        Codebar Workshops when I get stuck or need to discuss anything in 
        my project - these sessions are priceless. 
      </p>
      <p> 
        There's a parallel between starting a new building design or a new web app: 
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Setting out the objective - what problem am I trying to solve?
        </li>
        <li>
          What do I need to learn in order to achieve it? For example, when I needed a 
          Database and Authorization for an app, I learned how to use 
          AWS Amplify, Cognito and DynamoDB and GraphQL to access the information.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>
        I like to build things
      </h2>
      <p>
        This is the overarching theme of my career. I have been involved 
        in the design and documentation of a school, project-managed house 
        renovations, coordinated construction site logistics. The process of 
        creating something functional and tangible is extremely satisfying.
      </p>
      <p>
        Whether it's building a house, renovating a kitchen 
        or creating a web app - my approach to building is similar:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>What is the goal? What do we want to achieve?</li>
        <li>What skills / tools do I need to achieve it?</li>
        <li>Coordinating information and putting everything together to execute a solution!</li>
      </ul>
