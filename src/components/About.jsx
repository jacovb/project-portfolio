          I like to problem-solve
        </h2>
        <p>
          With building design, there’s constantly problems that need to be solved: 
          How to improve the layout of a room to enhance the function of the building / space. 
          How can facades be arranged / shaped to improve the light quality and 
          building climate inside. Ultimately, how to upgrade a User Experience.
        </p>
        <p>
          During construction, unplanned problems often surface - this requires quick 
          thinking to get to an alternative solution that would take you to the 
          same goal.
        </p>
        <p>
          I believe this way of thinking is an asset in Software Development - 
          solving User Problems, simplifying a service and creating a better 
          User Experience in the process.

        <h2>
          I like to learn

        <p>
          Disinterested about the career prospects along my current path, 
          I tried coding to see if I liked it. It quickly grew into a habit 
          of coding every day – I got hooked on learning, and I like it!
        </p>
        <p>
          After doing online courses through FreeCodeCamp, Scrimba, Udemy, 
          YouTube and University of Google the real learning leap came when 
          I started building my own projects using HTML, CSS, JavaScript 
          with React. When I needed a Database and Authorization for an app, 
          I learned how to use AWS Amplify, Cognito and DynamoDB and GraphQL 
          to access the information.
        </p>
        <p>
          The more I learn, the more there is to learn, but the pace of learning 
          would vastly improve if I was working in the field. Therefore, I am 
          seeking a Junior role as a Front-End Developer.

          I like to build things

        <p>
          This is the overarching theme of my career path. Starting as an 
          architect, then shifted more to the nuts and bolts of it, as an 
          Architectural Technician, add Project Management and Coordination and 
          that’s where I am today. The aim has always been to create.
        </p>
        <p>
          Teamwork, creativity, time-management and good communication are all 
          skills needed to build something - these are valuable skills that I can 
          offer as a Front-End Developer.
