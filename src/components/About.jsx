          I like to solve problems

        <p>
          Designing buildings and spaces is, essentially, creative problem solving: 
          <ul>
            <li>
              How to improve the layout of a room to enhance the function of the building / space?
            </li>
            <li>
              How can the building envelope be arranged / shaped to improve the light quality and building climate inside?
            </li>
            <li>
              Ultimately, how can the User Experience be improved or enhanced?
            </li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
          During the construction phase, problems pop up daily, which requires quick 
          thinking for alternative solutions that would reach the same goal.
        </p>
        <p>
          I believe this way of thinking and strategising is an asset for a Software Developer  
          by solving User Problems, simplifying a service or process and creating an improved 
          User Experience.
        </p>

        <h2>
          I like to learn
        </h2>
        <p>
          Disinterested in my career prospects in the construction industry, 
          I tried coding to see if I liked it. It quickly grew into a habit 
          of coding every day – I got hooked on learning, and I like it!
        </p>
        <p>
          After doing online courses through FreeCodeCamp, Scrimba, Udemy, 
          YouTube and University of Google the real learning leap came when 
          I started building my own projects using HTML, CSS, JavaScript 
          with React. When I needed a Database and Authorization for an app, 
          I learned how to use AWS Amplify, Cognito and DynamoDB and GraphQL 
          to access the information.
        </p>
        <p>
          The more I learn, the more there is to learn, but the pace of learning 
          would vastly improve if I was working in the field. What attracts me to 
          Software Development is the opportunity to continuously learn and grow.
        </p>

        <h2>
          I like to build things
        </h2>
        <p>
          This is the overarching theme of my career path so far. Starting as an 
          architect, then shifted more to the nuts and bolts of it, as an 
          Architectural Technician, add Project Management and Coordination and 
          that’s where I am today. It's incredibly satisfying to create something 
          tangible through hard work. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Teamwork, creativity, time-management and good communication are all 
          skills needed to build something - these are valuable skills that I can 
          offer as a Front-End Developer.
