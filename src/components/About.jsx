          From Architecture to Software Development
        </h1>

        <p>
          Disinterested in my career prospects in the construction industry, 
          I tried coding to see if I liked it. It quickly grew into a habit 
          of coding every day â€“ I got hooked on learning, and I like it!
        </p>
        <p>
          The more I learn, the more there is to learn, but my pace of learning 
          could vastly improve if I was working in the field. What attracts me to 
          Software Development is the opportunity to continuously learn and grow.
        </p>
        
        <h4>
          With my background in Design and Architecture, these are my top 3 transferable 
          skills as a self-taught Front-End Developer:
        </h4>

        <h2>
          I like to solve problems
        </h2>

        <h2>
          I like to learn
        </h2>

        <h2>

        <p>
          These skills are manifested and enhanced with Teamwork, Creativity, 
          Time-management and Good Communication - all valuable skills that 
          I bring to the table as a Front-End Developer.
